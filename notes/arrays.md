# Arrays

## What is an array?

* is a datastructure that stores a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations
* elements are accessed via index
* Homogeneous elements - all elements have same type

## Operations on arrays

1. Access
    * index bases access is fast: O(1)
2. Traversal
    * visiting each element one by one: O(n)
3. Insertion
    * at end: O(1) if space is available
    * middle: O(n) requires shifting
4. Deletion
    * at end: O(1)
    * middle: O(n) requires shifting
