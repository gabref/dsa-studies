# Stack and Queue

## Stacks

### Definition
* a stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out)

### Operations
* Push (insertion) - O(1)
* Pop (removal) - O(1)
* Peek - O(1)
* Is Empty - O(1)

### Advantages
* simple to implement
* fast insertion and deletion at the top
* used in function calls, undo operations, and expressions evaluation

### Disadvantages
* cannot access elements in the middle easily
* limited in flexibility compared to arrays or linked list

## Queue

### Definition
* a queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out)

### Operations
* Enqueue (insertion) - O(1)
* Dequeue (removal) - O(1)
* Front (peek) - O(1)
* Is Empty - O(1)

### Advantages
* useful for scheduling tasks (eg. CPU scheduling, printing jobs)
* maintains order of elements as they arrive

### Disadvantages
* fixed size in arrays unless implemented dynamically
* requires additional pointers for efficient linked list implementation

## Queues

### Definition
* linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle

### Operations
* Enqueue (insertion) - O(1)
* Dequeue (removal) - O(1)
* Front Peek - O(1)
* Is Empty - O(1)

### Advantages
* useful for scheduling tasks
* maintain order of elements as they arrive

### Disadvantages
* cannot access elements in the middle easily
* limited in flexibility compared to arrays or linked list
